<p align="center">Engineering Intelligence through LLMs, One Layer at a Time</p>

---

- An avid learner in deep pursuit of **mastery over Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
  
- Solely focusing on **build, orchestrate, and optimize performant LLM applications**.

💡 I believe in *learning by building*. Every major concept I study turns into a project. Boring concepts don’t stick; structured experimentation keeps me sharp.

📌 “If you can't implement it, you don't understand it.”  
— That’s the standard I hold myself to.
