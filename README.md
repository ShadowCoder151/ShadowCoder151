<p align="center">Engineering Intelligence through LLMs, One Layer at a Time</p>

---

As an avid learner, I am solely focused on mastering Large Language Models (LLMs) by building, orchestrating, and optimizing performant LLM applications.

💡 Always believe in *learning by building*. Every major concept I study turns into a project. Boring concepts don’t stick; structured experimentation keeps me sharp.

📌 “If you can't implement it, you don't understand it.”  
— That’s the standard I hold myself to.
